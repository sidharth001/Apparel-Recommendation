# Apparel-Recommendation
In this project we took the dataset from Kaggle. Our dataset has 183K rows and 19 features. Out of this we took 7 features and we performed various data analysis operations. We then eliminate the missing values after that we removed the duplicate values. This brought our dataset to 16K data values.
After that we applied various machine Learning Algorithms and measure the accuracy of the model.
Our model gives the algorithm for Apparel recommendation and is efficient and secure.
