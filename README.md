# Apparel Recommendation

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine-learning algorithm for apparel recommendations using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset initially contained 183,000 rows and 19 features. We selected 7 features for our analysis, performed various data preprocessing steps, and applied machine learning algorithms to build an efficient and secure recommendation model.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Initial Size:** 183,000 rows and 19 features
- **Selected Features:** 7 features
- **Final Size after Preprocessing:** 16,000 rows

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Feature Selection:** Chose 7 relevant features from the original dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Eliminated missing values.
   - Removed duplicate entries.
3. **Final Dataset:** Reduced to 16,000 rows after cleaning.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
We applied various machine learning algorithms to the preprocessed dataset and evaluated the accuracy of each model. The goal was to identify the most efficient and secure algorithm for apparel recommendation.

## Results
Our final model provides accurate and efficient apparel recommendations, ensuring both performance and security.
